# Talk-to-my-Projects

Interact with my projects to quickly assess their value and relevance to your academic or business needs. Check it out here: [talk-to-aman-projects.streamlit.app](https://talk-to-aman-projects.streamlit.app/)

## About

"Talk-to-my-Projects" is a repository that allows you to explore and understand the potential applications of my research works and projects through interactive conversations. The Streamlit app and LLaMA-3 language model enable users to determine if any of my projects align with their requirements efficiently.

## Key Features

- Curated list of my research works and projects
- Intuitive conversational interface powered by Streamlit and LLaMA-3-7B-Chat
- Quick assessment of project relevance and value to user needs
- Suitable for both academic and business use cases

## Method/Implementation:

### Efficient Keyword Extraction
- The `extract_keywords_custom` function utilizes Aman's library [AdaptKeyBERT](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/AdaptKeyBERT) model with the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' configuration for keyword extraction.
- It extracts keyphrases of 1-2 ngrams, excludes common stop words, and returns the top 10 most relevant keywords.
- This optimization ensures focused and meaningful keyword extraction from project descriptions.

### Caching and Performance Enhancement
- The `load_projects` function is decorated with `@st.cache` to cache the loaded projects dataframe.
- Caching avoids unnecessary reloading of the projects data on each app refresh, improving performance.
- A spinner is displayed during the loading process to provide a smooth user experience.

### Semantic Similarity Ranking
- The `rank_projects` function employs the SentenceTransformer model to generate embeddings for user keywords and project keywords.
- Cosine similarity is computed between the user and project embeddings to determine relevance scores.
- Projects are then ranked based on their similarity scores, enabling users to quickly identify the most relevant projects.

### Memory-Efficient Session State Management
- Streamlit's session state is utilized to store and manage user messages, context TLDRs, and the selected OpenAI model.
- By leveraging session state, the app maintains a consistent conversation flow without consuming excessive memory.
- The app also imposes a limit of 10 messages per user to ensure fair usage and prevent resource exhaustion.

### Contextual Project Information
- The app intelligently incorporates the top 3 most relevant project TLDRs into the conversation context.
- This allows the LLaMA-3 model to provide more targeted and informative responses based on the user's interests.
- The context is dynamically updated based on the user's input, ensuring the conversation remains relevant and engaging.

* _I've learned my lesson from being a bit too naive in the past. I didn't include licenses for some of my earlier projects, and as a result, they were used commercially without me knowing about it. Don't get me wrong, I would've been cool with it, but I would've loved to be involved or at least kept in the loop, you know? That's why I'm planning on adding a license to each of my projects from now on. It's nothing major, just a quick heads up email if you're planning on using my work for commercial purposes._
