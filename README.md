* _I've learned my lesson from being a bit too naive in the past. I didn't include licenses for some of my earlier projects, and as a result, they were used commercially without me knowing about it. Don't get me wrong, I would've been cool with it, but I would've loved to be involved or at least kept in the loop, you know? That's why I'm planning on adding a license to each of my projects from now on. It's nothing major, just a quick heads up email if you're planning on using my work for commercial purposes._
